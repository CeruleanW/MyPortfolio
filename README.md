# Asher Yang's Portfolio

> This is my portfolio, which has four pages: home, projects, about me, and contact

## Features

* Projects
  * My main projects will be shown here.
* Contact
  * The form in this page will send a request to my email service API serverd by Express.js on Heroku. Once a valid request is received, an email will be sent to my work email address.

## Links

Even though this information can be found inside the project on machine-readable
format like in a .json file, it's good to include a summary of most useful
links to humans using your project. You can include links like:

* Project homepage: <https://yiyangdev.me/>
* Repository: <https://github.com/CeruleanW/MyPortfolio/>
* Issue tracker: <https://github.com/CeruleanW/MyPortfolio/issues>
  * In case of sensitive bugs like security vulnerabilities, please contact
    my@email.com directly instead of using issue tracker. We value your effort
    to improve the security and privacy of this project!
